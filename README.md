Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client contracted Creative Technology Solutions to create a web-based version of their popular game Draw It or Lose It. The app currently only runs on Android devices but the Gaming Room wishes to expand it to other operating platforms as well. The software requirements that that were needed to meet the Gaming Rooms expectations included being able to have one or more teams playing at once, each team having multiple players and making sure team names and player names are different from one another.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a good job in listing out the required development tools needed for each operating system. By doing this, we have a good idea of what tools we need to properly implement the app whether it be for Mac, Linux, Windows or mobile devices.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found it helpful that the design document separated the developement process in to sections such as design constraints, requirements, evaluation etc. By viewing the development process in sections we got a good idea of how to move forward with implementing the app to be used on different platforms.

f you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the design constraints section of the design document. I listed 4 different design constraints but I feel it would've been more helpful to list a few more so that the team could be better prepared when it came down to expanding the app to other platforms.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs include being able to run the gaming app on different platforms as well as maintaining speed, quality and overall efficiency of the program. The development requirements section does a good job of lisitng the requirements for the needs of the user and for each different operating platform as well. It is very important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are usually the fundamental features needed to run an efficient program

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach for designing the software would be studying the design document until i get a good grasp on what it is that is being asked of me in order to fulfill the user's needs. Breaking down the project into separate sections just like in the design document so that the work doesnt feel clustered and overwhelming.
